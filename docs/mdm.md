## Metadata Management via Ontology Tagging

Metadata provides descriptive attributes to characterize data assets and related objects. Effectively capturing metadata sets the foundation for downstream governance, security, analytics and more.

However, metadata schemes can become fragmented across different teams, tools, and representations - obstructing a unified view of the enterprise knowledge graph. This is where ontology and tagging enters.

An ontology formally defines concepts and relationships within a domain of interest to enable unified meaning. Tagify leverages ontology terms to create a standardized taxonomy for classifying entities through semantic tags.

For example, the ontology models:

```
acme:CustomerPersonalData a rdf:Class;
                           rdf:type acme:SensitiveData .
                           
acme:OrderTransactions a rdf:Class;
                        rdf:type acme:TransactionData .   
```                 

Tagify exposes this ontology to tag data assets consistently:

**Table Tags**

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (id INT, name STRING) TAGS acme.customer.personaldata;

CREATE TABLE orders (id INT, amount DECIMAL) TAGS acme.order.transactions; 
```

**Column Tags**

```sql 
DESCRIBE TABLE customers;

id INT TAGS acme.customer.userid
name STRING TAGS acme.customer.fullname
```

Tagging is powered by the ontology relationships to enable rich metadata connectivity:

```
acme:CustomerPersonalData → acme.customer.personaldata
rdf:type → TAGS
```

As tag usage accrues more context builds:

```
MATH
- Calculus  
  - acme.course.polynomials TAGS Chapter5Table
  - acme.course.integrals TAGS Chapter7Rates
```  

This demonstrates how an ontology-based tagging approach delivers:

1. Shared conceptual foundation
2. Common metadata vocabulary
3. Consistent classification scheme
4. Network effects accumulating value

In effect, structured metadata gets woven into the organizational fabric rather than ending up in siloed dead ends. Tagify orchestrates this seamless embedding to drive circulation of meaningful metadata fueling downstream initiatives.
